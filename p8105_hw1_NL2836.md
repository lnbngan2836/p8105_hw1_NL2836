# Problem 1

First, we load the moderndive library.

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

This code chunk below downloads the dataset and views it.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
View(early_january_weather)
```

### Dataset short description:

- This dataset includes information about the weather in early January
  of EWR in 2013.

  `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`,
  `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visistb`, and
  `time_hour`. There are 358 rows, or 358 observations.
