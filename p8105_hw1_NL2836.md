# Problem 1

First, we load the necessary libraries.

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(tidyverse)
```

This code chunk below downloads the dataset and views it.

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
view(early_january_weather)
```

## a) Dataset short description

- This dataset includes information about the weather in early January
  of EWR in 2013.

- The dataset has 15 columns (i.e., variables), including `origin`,
  `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `temp`, `dewp`, `humid`, `wind_dir`,
  `wind_speed`, `wind_gust`, `precip`, `pressure`, `visistb`, and
  `time_hour`. There are 358 rows, or 358 observations.

- The mean temperature is 39.6.

## b) Scatterplots

- This code chunk makes a scatterplot of `temp` (y) vs `time_hour` (x)
  with color points using the `humid` variable and print the plot.

``` r
scatterplot_jan <- ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
print(scatterplot_jan)
```

### Describe plot pattern

- In EWR, the temperature (y axis) fluctuates between around 24F to
  around 58F during the first 15 days (x axis) of January in 2013. The
  humidity (color of the points) fluctuates from 30% to 100%. The 14th
  was the warmest day with high humidity.

### Export scatterplot

This code chunk export the scatterplot to the project directory.

``` r
ggsave("scatterplot_jan.png", width = 5, height = 5, dpi = 300)
```

# Problem 2

## Create a dataframe with:

- Random sample of size 10, standard Normal Distribution.
- Logical vector to indicate whether elements of the sample \> 0.
- A character vector of length 10.
- A factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”.

This code chunk creates the dataframe accordingly and view it.

``` r
random_df = tibble(
  sample = rnorm(10, mean = 0, sd = 1),
  log_vec = sample > 0,
  char_vec = c("a","b","c","d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  fac_vec = factor(
    sample(c("Group 1", "Level 2", "Level 3"), size = 10, replace = TRUE),
)
)

view(random_df)
```

## Take the mean of the variables

First take the mean of the variable `sample` in the dataframe and print
it.

``` r
mean(random_df$sample)
```

    ## [1] -0.2400385

Next take the mean of the logical vector `log_vec` in the dataframe and
print it.

``` r
mean(random_df$log_vec)
```

    ## [1] 0.3

Next take the mean of the character vector `char_vec` in the dataframe
and print it.

``` r
mean(random_df$char_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(random_df$char_vec): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Next take the mean of the factor vector `fac_vec` in the dataframe and
print it.

``` r
mean(random_df$fac_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(random_df$fac_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

### Description

- Only the mean of the `sample` and the `log_vec` variables can be
  determined.
- The mean of the `fac_vec` and `log_vec` cannot be determined since
  they are not numerical values.

## Convert the variables with `as.numeric`

`eval = FALSE` is used to specify no output of the code chunks when
render the document.

### Convert `log_vec`

``` r
as.numeric(random_df$log_vec)
```

Here the `FALSE` values are converted into 0 and the `TRUE`values are
converted into 1.

### Convert `char_vec`

``` r
as.numeric(random_df$char_vec)
```

Here the output is converted to `NA` (i.e., non applicable) because of
coercion. This is because there is no numeric value assigned for any
character value.

### Convert `fac_vec`

``` r
as.numeric(random_df$fac_vec)
```

Here the `fac_vec` values are converted into numerical values according
to their “levels”. This is because factor vector are categorical data,
and R determines the “levels” automatically based on the unique value of
the factor vector.
